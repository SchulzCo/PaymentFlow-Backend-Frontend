***Payment Flow: Backend-Frontend***


Backend
The backend handles the logic, database management, and server-side operations for payment processing. Here are the key points:
- Framework: Use Django 5 to create secure and efficient APIs.
- Features:- Payment Model:- Define a database schema to store payment details, such as:- User information
- Transaction amounts
- Status (e.g., pending, completed)


- API Endpoints:- POST /api/payments/: Processes a payment.
- GET /api/payments/: Retrieves payment history.

- Authentication:- Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT or OAuth) to secure the payment system.

- Integration with Third-Party Payment Gateways:- Integrate PayPal or Stripe for real payment transaction processing.




Frontend
The frontend provides an interactive user interface to manage the payment process. Below are the main features:
- Framework: Use Angular 17 for building a responsive and dynamic UI.
- Features:- Payment Form:- Design a user-friendly form to collect payment details (e.g., card information).

- API Integration:- Connect to the backend APIs to process payments and display confirmations.

- User Feedback:- Offer real-time feedback, such as:- Loading spinners
- Success or failure messages


- Routing:- Include navigation for:- Payment page
- History overview



- Reusable Components:- PaymentFormComponent: Handles payment submissions.
- PaymentHistoryComponent: Displays a record of past payments.
